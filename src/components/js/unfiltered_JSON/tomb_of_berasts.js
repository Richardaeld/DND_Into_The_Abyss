Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure\u2014direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler's ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started."

The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby.

She expects immediate discarding of centuries-long plots at her merest whim, and the price for disloyalty is a terrible vengeance.",

If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain.

											"In addition to their role as trained raiders in Veles-Sa, some spinosauruses live in or along most of the major river systems of the Southlands\u2014including the River Nuria. There they are also called \"river dragons\" or sometimes \"river walkers,\" and they are frequently associated with the worship of Baal- Hotep and Set. They are kept as sacred animals in several river temples, where they are fed regular meals and have been known to grow to enormous size and strength.",
											"Finally, along the Spice Coast, spinosauruses carry highvalue spice cargoes along the coast when banditry is rife or when a lizardfolk mercenary company is available to guard materials going north toward Mhalmet, Nuria, or Ishadia. These Spice Coast beasts are often especially bred for gaudy coloration: green-and-orange, blue-and-gold, and even redand- black bloodlines are spotted in the Spice Coast harbors."

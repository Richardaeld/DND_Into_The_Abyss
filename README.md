# Welcome to DM_Tool!
This project is designed to be a Dungeon Master’s cheat sheet for DND 5e. The original idea was to help a Dungeon Master (DM) keep track of player spells and have access to various tables with a few clicks of a mouse.

Every experienced DM knows a player that had to play a caster however they are always woefully unprepared for every session and cannot remember what their own spells do, require, etc…. This app was created with those players in mind! With a few clicks, any player can quickly and efficiently look up what their spells do from a phone, tablet, or pc.

Currently, this app provides a wealth of spells, dice rolls, and some quick reference tables for a DM to help ease the need for looking up materials during a session.

## Addition II
With a fully functional API in place the ability to create accounts, add characters and allow the tracking of player resource will be added.

# Technology
